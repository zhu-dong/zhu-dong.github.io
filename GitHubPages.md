* Create a repository

Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.

* Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```

* Hello World

Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:
```
cd username.github.io
echo "Hello World" > index.html
```

* Push it

Add, commit, and push your changes:
```
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```

* …and you're done!

Fire up a browser and go to https://username.github.io.
